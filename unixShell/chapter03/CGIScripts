	. A GGI program is a program that is used to provide interactivity, automation or database connectivity to a web site
	. A CGI program can be any type of program, including Bourne shell scripts: c script, perl script, bource shell script, etc
	. For a Bourne shell script to act as a CGI script, it must have the following attributes:

		- It must be executable
		- It must begin with the line #!/bin/sh
		- Any output produced must be recognised as a valid HTTP stream (anything that would ordinarily go to the terminal, to the screen). This requires that Standard Output begin with a line such as the following:
		Content-type: text/html # it can be html or text, is up to you. You must put Content-type independently of the type.
